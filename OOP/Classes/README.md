# Classes and Objects

Sample code: [Human.cs](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CSharp_MasterClass/blob/e15fda2d82f4d949cac99a25882f81935125abfe/OOP/Classes/Human.cs) and [Program.cs](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CSharp_MasterClass/blob/e15fda2d82f4d949cac99a25882f81935125abfe/OOP/Classes/Program.cs).

## Classes

Think of classes as blueprint or parents of an object. Classes are what objects are based on.

**Capabilities**:

1. They have actions or abilities (implemented using Methods).
2. They have properties, called member variables (ex. [firstName property of Human class](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CSharp_MasterClass/blob/e15fda2d82f4d949cac99a25882f81935125abfe/OOP/Classes/Human.cs#L11)).
3. Inheritance capabilities (classes can inherit another class).
4. They can be used as a custom data type.

## Objects

**Capabilities**:

1. They have DEFINED actions or abilities (ex. `IntroduceMyself` method).
2. They have DEFINED properties called member variables (ex. `firstName: Pratyaksh`).
3. ARE essentially a custom data type.
